Following features have been implemented in the project:

## Job Card
-->Each job listing should be displayed as a card containing the following information:

- **Job Title**
  The title of the job position.

- **Company Name**
  The name of the hiring company.

- **Location**
  The location of the job (e.g., city, state, country).

- **Job Description**
  A brief description of the job, limited to a certain number of characters with an option to expand for more details.

- **Experience Required**
  The required level of experience for the job.

- **Apply Button/Link**
  A button or link that allows users to apply for the job.

## Filters
Implemented filters to allow users to refine job listings based on the following criteria:

- **Minimum Experience**
  Users can specify the minimum years of experience required for job listings.

- **Company Name**
  Filter job listings by the hiring company's name.

- **Location**
  Allow users to filter jobs by specific locations (e.g., city, state, country).

  Filter jobs by different roles (e.g., frontend developer, backend engineer, project manager).

- **Minimum Base Pay**
  Users can specify the minimum salary or base pay for job listings.

## Infinite Scroll

Implement infinite scroll to load additional job listings automatically as the user scrolls down the page:

- **Dynamic Loading**
  Fetch and append more job listings from the backend when the user reaches the bottom of the current list.

## Responsive Design for various Devices

Ensure that the job listing platform is responsive and works well on different screen sizes, including mobile devices:
